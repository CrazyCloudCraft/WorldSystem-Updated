    About
</h2>
  
WorldSystem is a plugin where every player can get a world.</br>

There they can build, play and do anything they want without creating stress in a single world. The world owner can also add other players and manage their permissions on his world.</br>
When a player creates a new world you can also set a template which will then be cloned.
